Hello and welcome, my name is Tom and I am a beginner, this repro to document my learning - so if you are a complete beginner I hope you enjoy and we can learn together - if you are anything but a beginner you will know everything I am about to try and figure out. I will show my code as I am going.
An important note I will not get AI to code or debug anything but I may ask it for help, for instance ideas on how to complete a task - where I can find useful information and resources.

## 1
 
Today I will be trying to extract useful information from a data set - which I found  on Kaggle under the data set section
This data set has information on different Netflix shows and movies including type, title, duration and rating

I am going to be sing Jupiter notebooks s - its just a personal preference I like being able to run the code in sections 


-Goal of today: Given data, I need to put it into a table and find as much useful information as possible
- Column names
- Filter for specific types ie movie
- Parsing a column from string to int removing unnecescary string elements
- Descriptive statistics - max mean and min
- coutns for a column

After trying to find random information I got chatGPT to suggest a list of things I could find - the list is below - I will start with the easy things and work up to the harder ones
Easy:

Count how many entries exist for each content type
Find the total number of unique title
Identify the most frequent maturity ratings
Determine the most common genres
Find the top-producing countries
Show how releases are distributed over the years
Analyze how frequently new content is added over time
Calculate the average length of movies and series
Identify the longest and shortest content entries
Compare genre popularity between content types
Find which genres are most popular in each country
See which genres are associated with which ratings
Visualize when new content tends to be added throughout the year
Compare the average duration of older vs newer content


##3
Medium:
Find the most active directors
List actors with the most appearances
Discover actor pairings that appear together often
See which performers are associated with which genres
Find frequent collaborations between performers and directors
Extract and rank common keywords from descriptions
Generate word clouds by genre
Create comparison plots of type, rating, and genre combinations




##4
Group content based on description similarity
Build a recommendation system based on genre or cast similarity
Predict genre or maturity level based on the description text
Create visual networks showing collaborations among people
Forecast future content additions based on historical trends
Use modern NLP models to infer genre from summaries
Statistically test how genre and rating trends evolve over decades
Use topic modeling to uncover themes in descriptions
Cluster content using multiple metadata features


Notes for future:

When making a predicitve model:
Try a better model than Multinomial NB ie
Try LogisticRegression, RandomForest, or XGBoost
Use TF-IDF instead of CountVectorizer
Check that the groups you ar epredicting for are more evenly balanced and if not maybe group the smaller groups to make a larger group
